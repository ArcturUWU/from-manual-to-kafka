# kafka_dbs_learn 🚀
Big project with 5 databases that can help you master Kafka and hand-made synchronizing 🔧

# Project Purpose and Background
This project aims to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of Kafka and its applications by creating a suite of 5 databases that can be synchronized in real-time ⚠️. The project targets developers and data engineers looking to improve their skills in designing and implementing big data systems.

# Features and Functionality
The project includes the following key features:

* Supports 5 different databases: ElasticSearch, MongoDB, Neo4j, PostgreSQL, and Redis 🔥
* Provides real-time data synchronization between databases ⏱️
* Hand-made syncing using Python scripts 🔧
* Comprehensive documentation for easy setup and use 📚

What sets this project apart is its unique combination of Kafka and multiple database support, making it an ideal showcase for big data enthusiasts and professionals.

# Technology Stack
The project uses the following technologies:

* Python for scripting and data processing 💡
* Docker for containerization and easy deployment 🛠️
* No Next.js or React, as this project focuses on data processing and Kafka integration 💥

# Installation and Setup
To get started, follow these steps:

1. Install Docker on your machine 🛠️
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory ⬇️
3. Run `docker-compose up` to start the containers 🔧
4. Configure the databases and Kafka settings as needed 🔧

# Usage Examples
